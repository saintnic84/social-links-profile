## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got some good practice involving the width and heigh of my elements. Also, I offcially used google fonts in this project for the first time.

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link
    href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:ital,opsz,wght@0,14..32,100..900;1,14..32,100..900&display=swap"
    rel="stylesheet">
```
```css
.click {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    color: white;
    margin-top: 10px;
    width: 20em;
    height: 3em;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
```


### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This website is one of the resources online for front end developers. If there's a concept, code, or element you don't understand, you can probably find it at this site. This is where I got better equiped at understanding margin and padding.
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is a great website for both front end and back end programming languages, I regulary visit here to refresh concepts that I may have forgotten
